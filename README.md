# Axi SCMI Mailbox

The mailbox presents one singular Axi Lite slave port because in the Opentitan
integration, the Ibex core of the RoT is a master of the main Axi bus of the
Alsaqr Platform. So the arbitration is performed by the crossbar itself and two
ports are not needed. The registers are compliant to the SCMI protocol in terms
of width and address (offset). In this table the registers are shown:

| Offset   | Register        | Width (bit)   |
| -------- | ----------      | ------        |
| 0x00     | Reserved 1      |  32           |
| 0x04     | Channel Status  |  32           |
| 0x08     | Reserved 2      |  32           |
| 0x0C     | Reserved 3      |  32           |
| 0x10     | Channel Flags   |  32           |
| 0x14     | Length          |  32           |
| 0x18     | Message Header  |  32           |
| 0x1C     | Message Payload |  32           |
| 0x20     | Doorbell irq    |  32           |
| 0x24     | Completion irq  |  32           |

The regfile has been generated with the reggen tool, available in the
register_interface repository (as bender.yml dependency). The hjson file can be
found in the data/ directory. The SCMI documentation specify that the Message
Payload width is arbitrary, here it is 32 bit. The Reserved 2 and 3 regs are a
unique 64 bit register in the SCMI specification. To get a larger payload or
different data width for the registers, the reg file has to be generated with
those modifications ot the hjson. Moreover, to extend the payload width more
registers are needed, thus the doorbell and the completion irqs will be shifted
in offset by N*4 where N is the number of register that are introduced for the
Message Payload.

The output interrupts (doorbell and completion irq) are hard-connected to the
bit [0] of the corresponding registers throught a sync_wedge.
